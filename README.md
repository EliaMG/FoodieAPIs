# NPR API Elia Grenier
## Project Baseline

- Anticipate spending 10-15 hours on this project over the break week.
- Do at least an hour of thinking and research about a small, web-based project you would like to build. Focus on something you believe you can ship by the end of the week.
- Spend time thinking about the scope of the project. What does done look like? What is the __minimum viable project__ that you could ship that accomplishes the goal of your project?
- Create a repository on your personal Github account to house your project.
- Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes your project:
###Baseline Notes
  - What is the goal of the project?
   - I am going to use the "Food Topics" NPR API and the NYT article search API to create a webpage with stories about food organized by city (click on a city, get 5 articles/stories about food in that city)
  - Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
    - Mostly me, but it would likely be of interest to anyone who likes interesting facts about food or is visiting the cities I am able to find some stories about.
  - What are your personal learning goals?
    - Getting comfortable extracting data in XML or JSON from a new API
    - Practice with AJAX, JQuery and Javascript
    - Practice styling with Bootstrap
  - What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
    - Basic rails setup (not MVC)
      - Bootstrap
      - HTTParty gem
      - VCR gem for API hit testing
    - Trello
    - Jquery/Ajax/Javascript
    - JSON/API documentation
  - What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  - What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
    - MVP is a nicely styled homepage with buttons to at least two cities with 5 articles available
     - Tests for the Rails/API portions
    - Nice to haves:
      - Embedded audio
      - In page refreshing
      - Dynamically changing content (clicking on the button checks the API for new news stories)
- Create a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.
