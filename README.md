# NPR API Elia Grenier
## Project Baseline

- Anticipate spending 10-15 hours on this project over the break week.
- Do at least an hour of thinking and research about a small, web-based project you would like to build. Focus on something you believe you can ship by the end of the week.
- Spend time thinking about the scope of the project. What does done look like? What is the __minimum viable project__ that you could ship that accomplishes the goal of your project?
- Create a repository on your personal Github account to house your project.
- Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes your project:
###Baseline Notes
  - What is the goal of the project?
   - I am going to use the "Food Topics" NPR API to generate a webpage with stories from NPR about food.
  - Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
    - Mostly me, but it would likely be of interest to anyone who likes interesting facts about food.
  - What are your personal learning goals?
    - Getting comfortable extracting data in XML or JSON from a new API
    - Practice with AJAX, JQuery and Javascript (in page refresh)
    - Practice styling with Bootstrap
  - What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  - What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  - What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
- Creat a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.
